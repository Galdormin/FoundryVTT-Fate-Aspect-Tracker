# Fat Aspect Tracker

**Fate Aspect Tracker** is a simple module for [Foundry Virtual Tabetop](https://foundryvtt.com/) that allows the GM to keep track of the *aspect* and their *free invoke* in any kind of [Fate](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/) game. Only the GM can create, edit and delete aspects but every player can open **Fate Aspect Tracker** and see every aspect and their number of free invoke.

The module can be opened with the **book button** in the **scene menu**, **token tab**.

**Warning.** The data is recorded on a journal entrey named *"_aspect_tracker"* which is created by the module if it does not exist. If you delete this journal entry, you have to **reload** the game so that the module creates a new empty journal.
